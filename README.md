# Reinforcement Learning
Re-implementing sections of Sutton and Barto's "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" in Python. The package is more of a personal learning tool than anything else. For that reason, I focused on clarity and correctness of the underlying ideas rather than performance.

Will hopefully get around to a series of related blog posts soon!
